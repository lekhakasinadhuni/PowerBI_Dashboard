## Summary & Recommendations
- **Recovery Strategy for City Hotels:** Since City Hotels experienced the most revenue decline, management should consider offering discounts, staycations, and corporate packages to attract guests post-pandemic.
- **Peak Season Planning:** The revenue spike in August 2020 for Resort Hotels suggests seasonal demand, meaning targeted marketing and price adjustments can maximize revenue.
- **Parking Expansion in Resorts:** The higher parking usage at Resort Hotels suggests a need for additional parking facilities.
- **Revenue Diversification:** To mitigate risks from unpredictable events (e.g., COVID-19), introducing loyalty programs, long-stay packages, or alternative revenue streams (events, co-working spaces, etc.) can help stabilize earnings.

- Savings are mostly in Mutual Funds, but liquid cash is depleting
- A stable income helps financial stability, but reducing expenses can improve savings further
